#summary Public Methods for the jWizard Plugin

= Introduction =
As of version 0.3a, the plugin has been made a bit more object-oriented. (as much as Javascript will allow, since it is prototype-oriented) As such, there are now some internal methods that will be exposed to the user in order to make more flexible implementations of the Wizard.

= How to call upon these methods =
After instantiating jWizard
{{{
$([selector]).jWizard([options]);
}}}

To call an individual method:
{{{
$([selector]).data('jWizard').goToStep(3);
}}}

You can also store the jWizard object into a variable to make multiple references:
{{{
var jWizard = $([selector]).data('jWizard');
jWizard.goToStep(3);
}}}

= The Methods =
|| Method Name || Parameters || Description || Returns ||
|| goToStep() || (integer) index *required* || Programmatically set the current step of the Wizard || void ||
|| changeStep() || (jQuery) nextStep *required* || Programmatically set the current step of the Wizard (with a jQuery object instead of an index) || void ||
